A Simple Survey to determine if you should consider contacting your Health Care Provider about Diabetes Screening

A set of questions that our Machine Learning model will use to determine if you should consider talking to your Health Care Provider


_______________
Currently, the CDC reports that more than 130 million adults are living with diabetes or prediabetes in the United States. With an estimated 8.5 million
more who may be undiagnosed.   In order to know your status, it's important to work with your healthcare provider to discuss your current health status and
other factors that may play a part in developing diabetes.  

This site uses a machine learning model trained on data collected by the Centers for Disease Control to recommend whether or not you should talk to your provider.
Please note, this site should not be used to diagnose Diabetes in any person, but should be used only as a tool to facilitate discussions with a healthcare professional.
