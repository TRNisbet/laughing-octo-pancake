Machine Learning Plan

- After the data is manipulated and reformated, it will be put into a machine learning algorithm to accurately predict if a user should be screened for Diabetes.
- The three data sets will be compared to see how much of a difference the evaluations will be given the duplicates.
- We will be using multiple models to predict diabetes in a user including a logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest, and decision tree to get the most accurate results.
- Each model's performance will be evaluated using multiple tests including an accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.
- The best model will be chosen to be integrated in our website
