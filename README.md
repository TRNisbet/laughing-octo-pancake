## Overview
As the capstone project to the UNC DataAnalytics Bootcamp, students have been challenged to use a dataset to tell a story.  This collaborative project will be done in three phases, documented in this README.md file, along with documented code and other project collateral.  The phases are broken out as below: 
    - Sketch it Out - Decide on the project, question to answer, and model.  This will result in a project prototype
    - Build and Assemble - The team will train the model, build any related databases, and create the interactive dashboard and presentation 
    - Put it all together - The team will finalize the model, database and dashboard, and present the final project to the cohort. 
    
## Communication Methodologies and Team Responsibilities
The team will be communicating tasks and status via a dedicated Slack Channel.  Additionally, Zoom Calls will be held outside of classtime for the group to work together. 

The team will be doing pair/group programming on zoom calls to streamline the development process and ensure that they progress towards project goals and milestones.

## Topic 
The team considered a number of different topics, from recipe selection based on likes/dislikes and available ingredients, lottery number predictions, and healthcare data analysis.  Various data sets were reviewed as part of the consideration process.  The team settled on the topic of healthcare screening predictions as their topic.  Based on available datasets, they selected diabetes prediction based on various factors.  With a team  member being part of the  Healthcare Industry and other team members having interest in the area, the team felt that there could be beneficial impact to investigating Machine Learning related to health status and other factors.  

### Reasoning 
The team reviewed three different datasets before selecting the source dataset for their project.   As part of the consideration for each data set, the team was looking for questions in the data that most non medical people would be able to answer about their own health, as well as a considerable number of records that would allow them to build a model that would have high accuracy for prediction.  
##### Cancer Data Set 
The first file that was reviewed was the Lung Cancer Data Set (https://data.world/cancerdatahp/lung-cancer-data).  This data set had questions that most people shouuld be able to answer about their own health, however it only included 1000 records, which the team felt was not a large enough dataset to train a robust model for their project.  This data was not considered for use as part of this project. 

#### Cardiovascular Data Set 
The second dataset that was reviewed was the Heart Failure Prediction set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).  This data set included questions that most non medical people would not be able to answer about thier health, which made it less than ideal for use in a predictive model.  There were also only approximately 900 records in the dataset, which the team felt was not large enough to train a robust model. 

#### Diabetes Data Set 
The third dataset that was reviewed was the Binary Health Indicators dataset that is part of the Diabetes Health Indicators file (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv)  This file includes questions that most non medical people would be able to answer about their health.  It also includes over 250,000 records, which after pre-processing, would be large enough to train a robust predictive model.  This data set is based on telephone survey work completed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has already been pre-processed to remove a great deal of the 'noise' that can be available in public datasets.  

## Question to Answer
Based on the intial analysis of the data, and the goal of the project, the team will be attempting to answer the question "Should I be screened for Diabetes?" 

This question and its related answer will be based on information that is entered into our interactive website that will be passed through the trained machine learning model.  The model will return a prediction for the Diabetes_status field, which will then indicate if the respondant should schedule a visit with their primary care provider for diabetes screening.

## Data Overview 
The initial review of the dataset showed that there were 22 columns, with 253,680 records.  The columns in the dataset are described below: 

|Column Name|Description|

|Education|Indicates the level of education that a respondant reports|
|Income|Indicates the salary band that a respondant reports|

### Data Preprocessing and  Exploration Discussion 

#### Null Value Checks
There were no NaN(Null) values included in the dataset, so no records needed to be dropped.  

#### Potential Duplicate Record Removal Apporoach 

The dataset was scanned for duplicates.  There were 23899 records that were flagged by Python as a potential duplicate record. This was approximately 9.42% of the dataset. 'Duplicate' in this defintion would indicate all items were identical in the DataFrame.  However, because of the size of the dataset, and the consideration that many people could have the same results when surveyed. The team decided to build the model using a file that contains the potential duplicate records, and files that have had them removed.  This will help determine if there is additional weighting being added to the 'duplicate' records as part of the prediction process. 

##### Duplicate Review and Removal 
The team determined that they would process the original dataset three different ways.  
- Raw Data - No duplicates were removed from the data, and binning was done on identified columns. (Data Processing - Raw Data Notebook)
- Sample One - Duplicates were identified and removed prior to binning being done.  (Data Processing - Sample One Notebook)
- Sample Two - Duplicates were identified and removed after binning was complete. (Data Processing - Sample Two Notebook)
These files were run through the models and there was no difference in results.  The team determined that it would be best to run a file where binning was done and no duplicate records were returned. 

### Binning 
Due to the nature of the data in the dataset, the team decided that binning on selected columns was appropriate.  Binning was done as indicated below 

|Column |Binning Notes|
|-------|-------------|
|Diabetes_012|Binned to include respondents in one of two buckets, indicating they already have a Diabetes diagnosis or they do not|
|BMI|Binned to fall into one of 4 bins, (0-18.5, 18.5-24.9, 24.9-29.9, 29.9-100)|
|MentHlth|Binned into one of 6 bins, 0-4 days, 5-9 days, 10-14 days, 15-19 days, 20-24 days, 25-30 days|
|PhysHlth|Binned into one of 6 bins, 0-4 days, 5-9 days, 10-14 days, 15-19 days, 20-24 days, 25-30 days|

Bins for BMI were determined based on CMS classification data definitions for underweight, normal, overweight and obese based on BMI.  Bins for Mental and Physical health dates were broken into 5 day increments by default. 

Additional binning for age, income scale and education level were not done by the group.  These elements were already binned in the source data, with those bins being defined in the Codebook associated with the original dataset.  (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf)

### Database Construction
The team consulted with Kristina regarding the development of a database.  They were advised at that time that no free standing database would be needed for their project and that CSV files could be used without penalty. 

### Machine Learning Model 
As part of the project work, the team reviewed various  Machine Learning models to use as part of the decision process the final project would employ.  

#### Linear Regression Model 
The linear regression model tested by the team returned an 84.24% accuracy when executed against the dataset.  The confusion matrix and classification report showed the following:

#### Decision Tree Model
The decision tree model tested by the team returned a 77.55% accuracy when executed against the dataset.  The confusion matrix and classification report showed the following:

#### Random Forest Classifier 
The random forest classifier model tested by the team returned an accuracy score of 84.07% when executed against the dataset.  The confusion matrix and classification report showed the following: 

![alt text](https://github.com/TRNisbet/laughing-octo-pancake/blob/main/Images/RDT_one.jpg)

This model also returned a list of features that showed that age, income, general health, education and BMI range being the highest importances in whether or not a person has diabetes.   Due to this accuracy score and the feature listing that closely  matches the correlation returned during the data exploration phase, the team chose to use this model as part of the final refinement of the project. 

#### Performance Optimization and Analysis
The team is continuing to review and enhance the performance of each model prior to making a final selection.  The team will also be processing each of the different data files created during the pre-processing phase of the project to determine if that factors into the model decision c hoice. 

After review and enhancement of the Random Forest Classifier model, the team determined that while the percentage of accuracy was high, the model did not accurately predict a patient being at risk of diabetes as accurately as hoped.  After the model was built, a subset of data with known results were run through the model and did not return the same results.  This is most likely due to the dataset being heavier in the 'not at risk' category weighing the model more heavily in that direction.  The training set run through the model had 50677 records accurately scored at 'not at risk' and 2264 scored 'at risk' while 7730 were falsely identified to be at risk and 2749 were falsely identified to be 'not at risk'.  

For the purpose of this project however, a successful machine learning model is encouraging, and it is felt that a more accuracte prediction model is possible.  Additional review and oversampling of data improved this performance.  Additional 'positive' records were added to the source dataset, and the model was trained again.  The results of this model returned an 87.32% accuracy rate, with 46307 true negatives and 26524 true positives.  When the test records were run through the model, they all returned a 'positive' record which was an improvement over the original.  

### Interactive Site Building 
While the Machine Learning model was being built, the initial site build was occurring in parallel.  The team utilized HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build what is displayed below: 

![alt text](https://github.com/TRNisbet/laughing-octo-pancake/blob/main/Images/InitalSiteBuild.jpg)

This site utilizes a Bootstrap accordion framework to expand and collapse various sections and utilize the available space on the page efficiently.   When the accordion section is expanded, it shows interactive sections that display visualizations, or allow a user to answer questions that will be processed through the Machine Learning model for predictions.

### Background Functionality 
Flask and Ajax were utilized by the team to build the interactive site.  The site is active within a Flask environment, and when the end user selects values from the survey and clicks submit, the python code in the app.py file is triggered to run the prediciton  model and return results.  Thes results are displayed on the screen for the user. 

### Future Work 
For future work on this project, the team has the following goals: 
    - Improve the Machine Learning model to more accurately predict true positive and negative results 
    - Add additional resources and documentation to the site for informational resources for end users.
