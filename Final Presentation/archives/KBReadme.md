Data Analytics Boot Camp Final Project

1/18/23 - Work Session Notes 

This week:

> Decide on a topic for your project
    Juvenile Dx prediction based on information provided by an end user 
    Visualizations should be based on the data
        How many patients with X have diabetes? 
            Base off of the graphs that are already in the dataset (for confirmation)
            Then make them dynamic once that's done 
        How many patients with your answers have diabetes? 

> Find a dataset for your project
    Possible link for Juvenile Diabetes Indicators <<<<<<
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset

    Possible link for Cardiac Indicators
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

    Possible link for cancer indicators (lets expand beyond BC)
        https://data.world/cancerdatahp/lung-cancer-data

> Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset
    >Kellie will build workflow diagram  
    >Kellie (point), Tom  and Rachel will be working on Exploratory and cleanup

> Create a Database 
    > Rachel will be the point on the database 

> Andrew will be point on ML 

> Ash will build visualizations 


Today's Agenda:
> Present a project to stakeholders 

> Design a database using ERD  
    Don't necessarily need to build a database database, but we can use CSV files/dataframes for our database 

> Design a machine Learning Model 


Things that get turned in: 

> Create a Mockup of a Machine Learning Model

> Create a mockup or fabricated database using an ERD 

> Create an outline for the final dashboard

> Create branches on GitHub with working code for the EDA 

> Group Product Checkin 
    What you hope to achieve
    What steps are being taken
    Your current progress 
    What you plan on getting done by next week 


To do next: 
Check Datatypes
Change Strings to Int
Check for Dupes
Remove Dupes 
Determine if any data needs filtered 
Count number of yeses for target columns 
Determine % of yeses for target columns 
use get_dummies for all columns 
drop columns where necessary 



Write to Training DataFrame
