## Attendees
- Kellie
- Rachel
- Tom

## Purpose
The purpose of this meeting was the following:
- Review dataset:
    - Any null values?
    - Any duplicates?
    - Can any columns be dropped?
    - How are we binning:
        - BMI
        - MentHlth
        - PhysHlth


## Result
Here are the results from our meeting:
- There are no null values.
- There are about 25,000 duplicates.
- The lowest percentage of answers was around 4%.
- We are binning:
    - BMI:  
        - "Underweight: less than 18.5"
        - "Healthy: 18.5 - 24.9"
        - "Overweight: 25 - 29.9"
        - "Obese: 30 - higher"
    - MentHlth:
        - 0 Days
        - 1-5 Days
        - 6-10 Days
        - 11-15 Days
        - 16-20 Days
        - 21-25 Days
        - 26-30 Days
    - PhysHlth:
        - 0 Days
        - 1-5 Days
        - 6-10 Days
        - 11-15 Days
        - 16-20 Days
        - 21-25 Days
        - 26-30 Days

The above image shows a screenshot of the code found to utilize for binning.

## Summary
There are no null values to drop. We recommend running two models. One with the duplicates removed and one with the duplicates not removed. We are interested in the difference.
Based on the number of columns and the lowest percentage of answers, we do not recommend dropping any columns.
The bins were determined based on the CDC guidlines for BMI and broken down into day counts for MentHlth and PhysHlth.

## Misc. Notes
- We will need a .md file on the top page of git hub with what each answer means.
- Most binary questions will need an unknown, but might need to return a value of "not enough info" if to many are answered unknown.
- Columns in df might not mirror the order on the website
- Make sure in presentation to discuss the question of removing duplicates or similar answered question
